The candidate demonstrates a good understanding of the dialogues and is able to express themselves clearly. However, there are some errors in grammar and vocabulary, which are likely due to the ASR's poor robustness rather than the candidate's inability. For example, in the first dialogue, the candidate says \"bol\u00ed\u0159ku\" instead of \"bol\u00ed\u010dku\", which is a common mistake. In the second dialogue, the candidate says \"poletn\u011b\" instead of \"poledne\", which is another common mistake. Additionally, the candidate's pronunciation is not always clear, which may be due to the ASR's poor robustness. However, the candidate is able to communicate effectively and is able to understand the examiners' questions and respond accordingly. Overall, the candidate's spoken Czech proficiency is at the B1 level, and with some practice and improvement in grammar and vocabulary, they may be able to reach the B2 level."}

For example, in the first task, the candidate says \"Tak mus\u00edm \u0159\u00edct, kam m\u016f\u017eu j\u00edt?\" instead of \"Pros\u00edm, \u0159ekn\u011bte mi, kam bych mohla j\u00edt?\". In the second task, the candidate says \"Jela jsem do \u00fastina Tlabe\" instead of \"Jela jsem do \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem\". The candidate also has difficulty with pronunciation, as seen in the phrase \"Tam bylo vetro\u0161e\" instead of \"Tam bylo v\u011btr\u016f\u0161e\".

However, it's worth noting that some of the errors made by the candidate are due to the ASR's poor robustness, and not due to the candidate's inability. For example, the ASR incorrectly transcribes the candidate's response to the question 'Jak\u00e9 ro\u010dn\u00ed obdob\u00ed m\u00e1te r\u00e1da a pro\u010d?' as 'Pomalu pros\u00edm' instead of 'Pomalu pros\u00edm, jak\u00e1 ro\u010dn\u00ed obdob\u00ed?'."}
