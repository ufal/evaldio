# EvaldioData 1.0

EvaldioData 1.0 is the language corpus of spoken performances by non-native speakers of Czech.
It includes recordings capturing the oral part of the [Czech Language Certificate Exam](https://ujop.cuni.cz/UJOPEN-70.html?ujopcmsid=12:czech-language-certificate-exam-cce). 
The recordings consist of dialogues between the examiner (a native speaker) and the candidate (a non-native speaker). 
In addition to the recordings, the corpus also contains their transcriptions, which are richly linguistically annotated. 
Some recordings are accompanied by multiple transcriptions from different annotators, allowing for comparisons of various transcripts of the same recording and evaluations of the degree of consistency in converting spoken language into written text.
The current version focuses on the A2 level (according to the CEFR), which is required for the granting of permanent residency in the Czech Republic.

The corpus is available also as a [specialized public database](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/teitok-live/evaldio/index.php) aimed at providing a structured and easily accessible source of authentic spoken data for linguists, educators, students, the scientific community, and the general public.

The corpus was created at the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/) to support teaching, research, and assessment of language competence among non-native speakers of Czech as part of the project [_Automated Speech Scoring in Czech_](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/automated-speech-scoring-czech).
Audio recordings were provided by the [Institute for Language and Preparatory Studies, Charles University](https://ujop.cuni.cz/UJOPEN-1.html) (ujop.cuni.cz).
