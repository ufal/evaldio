Assess the performance of a candidate (CAND_1) in an oral {true_level_for_prompt}-level Czech exam based on the provided transcript. The exam is divided into multiple exercises. Each exercise must be evaluated separately.

 * Interaction: how well does the candidate engage in interaction with the examiner (EXAM_*)?
 * Lexical Resource: does the candidate use appropriate and varied vocabulary for the level?
 * Grammatical Accuracy: is the candidate's use of grammar appropriate and accurate for the level?

For each trait, do the following:
 * Assign a score between 0 and 100.
 * Provide a brief explanation justifying the score, with examples from the transcript.
